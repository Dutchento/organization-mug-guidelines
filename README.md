# Guidelines for organizing Magento User Groups

You (want to) organize MUGs? Cool! Thank you so much for putting in the time and effort to organize these local Magento meetups and bringing the community together on regular basis. **You are awesome!**

We already have a general [Code of conduct](https://github.com/Dutchento/organization-code-of-conduct) for our community. This document is an addition to that specificly for organizers of the MUGs.

To align ourselves, have a consistent image and make sure your MUG gets the attention it deserves, we do have some tips & guidelines for you. If you have any questions/remarks about these, please let us know or submit a change!

## How to start:
- Request a Meetup.com group from Dutchento for your region (if non exists) or request access to an existing one.
- Suggest/plan a new meeting with a topic and proposed date/location. The more concrete you can be, the better/faster it will be received.
- Let the people at Dutchento know so they can help you promote it. We will also add you to our Slack discussion group for MUG organizers.

## What do we expect from you as an organizer:
- Organize regular meetups. Once every 3 months is a good pace to start with.
- The meetups should be open to anyone that wants to join.
- Coordinate dates, speakers, topics with surrounding MUG organizers.
- If you are organizing this as a commercial company, some promotion in exchange for your effort is ok. But the meetup should still be open to visitors and speakers from your competitors. This is encouraged in order to promote the local community cohesion and collaboration.
- We would like you to setup a pull-up banner from Dutchento. Request one in time and we will deliver them to you :).
- Talk to potential speakers and refer them to the speakers form: https://goo.gl/forms/4uCHomUqP37z32iC3

## When following these guidelines, you can expect the following from Dutchento:
- Promotion of your MUGs through our website and social channels.
- Access to our network of the best speakers from other events.
- You can join and (if needed) vote during our yearly MUG strategy meeting.
- When organizing 4 MUGs or more per year, you get 4 free tickets to our yearly Meet Magento event for you and you team!
- Sponsorship of meetups to pay for the costs of location and (some of the) drinks.

## Things to know for MUG organizers and others:
- Local MUG organizer(s) are the fist point of contact for speakers and attendees.
- MUG ideas/topics can be shared or rolated if agree upon the creator of ideas/topic (respect to others).
- Misbehave at/of MUG's, participents or others can/will be reported to Dutchento.
- Dutchento is not in the lead of the idea(s)/topic(s)/program, this is done by the MUG orginizer (But we are happy to help if needed).
