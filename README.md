# Guidelines for organizing Magento User Groups

What do we expect from you as an organizer:
- Organize regular meetups. Once every 3 months is a good pace to start with.
- The meetups should be open to anyone that wants to join.
- Coordinate dates, speakers, topics with surrounding MUG organizers.
- If you are organizing this as a commercial company, some promotion in exchange for your effort is ok. But the meetup should still be open to visitors and speakers from your competitors. This is actually encouraged to promote the local community cohesion and collaboration.


When following these guidelines, you can expect the following from Dutchento:
- Promotion of your MUGs through our website and social channels.
- Access to our network of speakers.
- sponsorship of meetups to pay for the costs of location and (some of the) drinks.
